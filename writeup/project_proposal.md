##Chosen study
Zhao, M., Bülthoff, H. H., & Bülthoff, I. (2016). **Beyond faces and expertise: Facelike holistic processing of nonface objects in the absence of expertise.** Psychological science, 27(2), 213-222.

##Justification
  I currently study the visual cortex, with a specific interest in face perception and recognition. In a previous lab, I investigated the role of holistic face processing in acquired prosopagnosics, using the composite-face effect to measure holistic processing [1]. While one prominent theory is that deficient holistic processing is a root cause of face processing and recognition deficits in prosopagnosics, I found that four of the seven prosopagnosics tested actually showed intact holistic processing. The study I've chosen is directly relevant to this previous research. This study finds that nonface objects, specifically line patterns with salient Gestalt ionformation, can elicit holistic processing (also as measured by the composite effect), even in the absence of expertise. This result has serious implications for how the field views holistic processing, especially for the central and selective role it has traditionally been considered to play in face perception. 

##Stimuli and procedures
  In order to replicate this experiment, I will need a stimuli set of 160 pairs of composite faces (created from 20 initial face pairs) and 160 pairs of composite line patterns (created from 20 initial line pairs). Ideally, the authors will be willing to share their stimuli set. If not,  the line patterns used are provided in the supplementary information and I have access to face stimuli that could presumably be used to create the composite face pairs. However, creating the stimuli set would then require sorting the faces and line patterns so that the same/difference, congruent/incongruent, and aligned/misaligned conditions are matched in frequency of each face or line pattern. This would be somewhat challenging, though doable. 

  The procedure is relatively straightforward and the task could be administered through Amazon Turk. Every participant would need to complete two composite tasks (one with faces and one with line patterns), each with 8 practice trials and then 160 experimental trials. A trial consists of a stimulus, followed by a mask, followed by a second (pair) stimulus. Participants are then asked to determine whether the top parts of the two faces or line patterns they saw were same or different. The measure of interest is response sensitivity, calculated using hit and false alarm rates, so luckily response times will not need to be collected. Assuming average response times of ~ 3 seconds (although the authors did not impose a time limit), this study would take approximately 28 minutes per participant (not including instructions or short breaks). Additionally, the original sample size was only 20 participants, so an Amazon Turk replication should hopefully be financially feasible.
